## Per SNP quality control

#### Identification of SNPs with elevated missing data rates

#### Test markers for different genotype call rates between cases and contols

#### Minor Allele Frequency

#### SNPs failing Hardy Weinberg equilibrium

-   If the frequency of observed genotypes of a variant in a population
    can be derived from the observed allele frequencies, the genetic
    variant is said to be in Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium.
-   Genotype frequencies remain stable from one generation to another in
    the absence of any evolutionary pressure (selection, mutation and
    migration).
-   The goodness-of-fit test is used to test HWE is not a powerful test
    and reliability of results depends on the sample size.

-   Rule of thumb: the heterozygote frequency can only reach a maximum
    of 50%. If heterozygote frequencies are more than 50%, it is a clear
    sign of HWD, regardless of statistical test result.
-   Most common reason is not biological, **genotyping error** is most
    plausible exploration.
